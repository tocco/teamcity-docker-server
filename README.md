## TeamCity Server Image Dockerfile

This project contains the Dockerfile and all necessary scripts to build the Docker image and run a TeamCity server inside a container.

You can pull the ready-to-use image from the Docker Hub repository
                                     
`docker pull jetbrains/teamcity-server`

If you need to build your own image, you need to perform the following:

1) Pull our base image and re-tag it 
```
docker pull jetbrains/teamcity-base
docker tag jetbrains/teamcity-base teamcity-base
```
You can use your own base image with the operation system of your choice and JAVA installed. TeamCity relies on the `JRE_HOME` environment variable. Just tag your own image with the `teamcity-base` tag.

2) Extract TeamCity.tar.gz of any version you'd like to use into  the `dist/teamcity` folder. In the same directory where the Dockerfile is placed, run
```
mkdir dist
tar zxf TeamCity-<version>.tar.gz -C dist/
mv dist/TeamCity dist/teamcity
```
3) Run the `docker build` command:
```
docker build -t teamcity-server
```

See our [detailed instructions] (https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-server/) on how to use the image in the Docker Hub repository .
